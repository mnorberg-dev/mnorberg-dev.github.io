**Disclaimer:** This presentation was originally created when the technology was called **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**. Databricks has since rebranded it as **Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines**. While the name has changed, many of the strategies and techniques for applying data quality rules remain the same. For the latest documentation, see the [Databricks Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines docs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dlt/).

Ensuring high data quality is critical for analytics, decision-making, and building reliable AI/ML models. Without it, organizations risk costly errors, unreliable insights, and ineffective models.  

In this talk, I share a practical guide to implementing **data quality expectations** within Databricks’ Delta Live Tables (DLT). Think of expectations as “unit tests for data” — rules that define what your data should look like. By applying them, you can:  

- Measure the proportion of data that meets quality standards  
- Quarantine or block bad data before it flows downstream  
- Detect bugs in code that cause quality issues  
- Lay the foundation for data quality monitoring and reporting  

The session walks through a **four-step process** for writing expectations: profiling your data, collaborating with domain experts, documenting rules, and translating them into SQL. I also share lessons learned, tips for managing quarantines, and strategies to balance strict vs. loose expectations.

Whether you’re a developer working hands-on with DLT pipelines or simply looking to understand how to raise the bar on your organization’s data quality, this talk will give you actionable tools to get started.
