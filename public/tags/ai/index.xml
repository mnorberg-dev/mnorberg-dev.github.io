      <title>Tracing with Databricks Mosaic AI Gateway: A Practical Guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mosaic AI Gateway is Databricks’ system for managing and governing how your organization uses large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. Out of the box, it includes features like permission and rate limiting, payload logging, usage tracking, AI guardrails, fallbacks, and traffic splitting. These tools give teams tighter control over their AI workloads — making it easier to manage access, monitor performance, and keep costs in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Mosaic AI Gateway comes with many powerful features, one capability is still missing: MLflow Tracing. Tracing is like logging with context — it doesn’t just capture the request and response, but also the intermediate steps that reveal what happened inside your AI system when something goes wrong. Without it, visibility into model behavior can be limited. As you’ll see, MLflow traces can be an invaluable tool when debugging or optimizing an LLM workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
