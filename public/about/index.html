My Journey in Data Engineering
I’ve always had a passion for programming and problem-solving, which first led me down the path of software engineering during my undergraduate studies. In graduate school, I started working more with data, earning a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. This combination of software engineering and data expertise naturally led me to data engineering—a perfect middle ground between building robust systems and working with meaningful data.

Added this content to a vector index to power a search application, making it easier for customers to find support and internal teams to access knowledge.\nWordPress Website Ingestion: Created a Python connector from scratch to ingest the entire company WordPress site into Databricks. Implemented retry and backoff logic to handle API failures or network issues. Designed workflows to capture the full website on day 1, then only incremental changes on subsequent days—ensuring that temporary failures don’t require manual reruns and the system automatically catches up the next day.\nCI/CD \u0026 Automation: Configured service principals and created Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines using Infrastructure as Code practices for reliable, repeatable deployments.\nDocumentation \u0026 Knowledge Sharing: Created Confluence documentation for all key processes, designed for future ingestion into a company-wide vector database to make knowledge accessible to other engineers.\nOutside the Data World When I’m not working with data, I like to stay active and explore the outdoors. Golfing and hiking are two of my favorite ways to recharge and stay focused, and I also love rock climbing, which keeps me on my toes—literally and figuratively!\nI’m also a huge pizza and coffee nerd:\nI’ve learned to make pizza dough from scratch, and true to my data-driven nature, I’ve kept a tally in 2025 of every pizza I’ve made. Nearly every morning, I make a pour-over coffee using my V60, my favorite coffee brewer. My go-to beans are typically light to medium roasts from George Howell Coffee. I also genuinely enjoy tinkering with personal coding projects, experimenting with new tools, and learning ways to make complex systems simpler and more efficient. And just like in my professional life, I love solving puzzles—whether it’s in code, a tricky climbing route, or perfecting a pizza crust!\nI’m always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, share what I’ve learned, and continue growing as a data engineer.
